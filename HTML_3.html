<div class="panel">
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        Being a 1st Year College Student, I am quite unsure as of now as to what my plans would be after graduating. For sure, finding a job is a top priority but 
        given the fact that the IT Industry is such a huge industry, I have yet to find the most suitable job for me. I guess that's part of a story of my future that
        I have yet to read and walk through but one thing is certain, I hope to have a job that I am passionate about and a job that makes everyday a day I expect to come
        with full anticipation and inspiration.

<button class="accordion">MESSAGE TO MY "SELVES"</button>
<div class="panel">
    <h2><b>PAST SELF</b></h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
    To my past self, I am forver thankful to you as you're the reason for who I am today. You are me and I am you, you made me and I cherish whatever you made.
    I know that you went though a lot and the road you took is not the easiest and so I thank you for that. I know you very well as I am you and you are me and
    so I'd like to give you an advice. Stop thinking of what other people say or think about you. Stop trying to please others by showing a fake you and just
    be yourself. You are perfect just the way you are, perefectly imperfect. I am from the present day and trust me, you will be much happier this way.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2><b>PRESENT SELF</b></h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
    To my present self, I am so proud of how far you've come and I am happy that you are starting to be more true to yourself. You're still young so explore things
    and keep doing the things you love. Keep the passion burning for the things you love to do and most of all, work and study hard. Times may get tough but know 
    that everyhting will pay off well in the end. Fighting!
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2><b>FUTURE SELF</b></h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
    To my future seld, I don't what you are and what you do nor I have the faintest idea whether the dreams that were once born in my mind were materialized or achieved.
    Whatever it may be, I am proud of you and know that I am always rooting for you. You're probably not far off the distant future so I would assume you still have a 
    lot of time but be aware that time can pass fast with all the happy and joyous moments you encounter. With that said, do things you want to do so in the end you won't 
    regret anything and even if you think it's something you should do, always remember this, "Make mistakes but don't regret them, learn from them."    
    </p>

<div class="panel"><p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
    In 10-15 years, you'll be a man happy with your life and the path you're taking. You'll be a humble IT worker under a huge a company where you earn money just enough
    to buy your own place and buy things you need or like. Most of your money are being saved because you'll be travelling across the world to witness breathtaking views,
    experience life outside the country you're born, and meet new people as well as friends along the way.
